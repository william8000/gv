Installing GNU gv
=================

TIP: See INSTALL.generic for detailed help about the `configure'
script.

TIP: If you got this gv distribution from CVS please read the section
entitled `Bootstraping CVS gv' at the end of this document.


Quick guide
-----------

   $ ./configure
   $ make
   $ su
   # make install 

Detailed guide
--------------

You can customize some aspects of gv at compilation-time giving
parameters to the `configure' script.

The relevant options are:

  --enable-ps-level-one   Produce Level 1 PostScript

If defined: PDF to PostScript conversion will produce Level 1
PostScript. Otherwise Level 2 PostScript is generated.
Don't activate this unless you have gs 4.00 or newer.

  --enable-signal-handle  

Use a signal handler intercepting SIGTERM,SIGQUIT, SIGHUP snd SIGINT
signals. It requires X11R6.  Defaults to `yes'

  --enable-backing-pixmap 

Use a backing pixmap and not rely on the XServer to maintain backing
store (can be changed at runtime).  Defaults to `yes'

  --enable-scrollbar-code 

Use gv's own Motif like scrollbar. It defaults to `yes'

  --enable-memmove-code   

Use gv's own memmove. It defaults to `yes'

  --enable-runtime-messages
                          
If defined gv will give informative messages at runtime. It defaults
to `no'.

  --enable-fallback-styles
                          
Compile X resource files into the executable. Defaults to `yes'

  --enable-memdebug-code  

Use extra code for debug memory operations. It defaults to `no'

  --with-default-papersize=PSIZE

The default papersize (can be changed at runtime). Defaults to `a4'
(european standard). Americans will likely want `letter' instead.

  --with-print-command=COMMAND

Command for spool a print job. Defaults for `lpr' (fine if using both
`lpd' and CUPS).

  --with-user-defaults-file=PATH

The file containing your preferences. It defaults to `~/.gv'.

  --with-scratch-dir=PATH 

Temporary directory. Must be terminated with a trailing `/'. Defaults
to `/tmp/'

  --with-save-dir=PATH    

The default directory for saving. Must be terminated with a trailing
`/'. Defaults to `~/'


Bootstraping CVS gv
-------------------

If you got this gv distribution from CVS you must bootstrap it in
order to obtain the `configure' script.

You can either do it manually, invoking `autoreconf':

    $ autoreconf -i

or using the `bootstrap' script written by Karl Berry (recommended
way):

    $ ./bootstrap
